This project started as a wrapper around jdupes and jdupes.txt, pretty neat program.
It works really well, with some customizations in ranger, it would pretty quickly show duplicate files in the browser, and where the duplicates reside, etc.,
Very helpful trimming down backups, and knowing for sure, what you delete, still exists somewhere else...

However, I'm a bit annoyed with how long indexing takes (understandibly, since it uses hashes)

Will now attempt a new version that only looks at file-sizes and file-names, see if that results in 80% of the features with much better performance.
